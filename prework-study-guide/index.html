        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, defines charset: element sets our character coding, viewport: element sets the default view of our webpage, http-equiv: sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>At the very top we see the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>Next after the declaration we see the html opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. Inside the html tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser language for the webpage</li>
          <li>div element used to create a division in the page.</li>
          <li>span element used to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>The words "element" and "tag" are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>p elements represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage and can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li> The alt attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The link element can be used to linke an external CSS file to an HTML file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external source.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is applied when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet is used to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage, this is preferred because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes designs easier.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two importatn components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property, for example the declaration color:blue; includes the CSS property "color" and the value for that property "blue"</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word document, it indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabitated by two values: true/false.</li>
          <li>NaN is a special kind of number value that's typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number.</li>
          <li>BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude. With BigInts you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyonf the safe integer limit.</li>
          <li>String type represents textual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values UTF-16 code units.</li>
          <li>Arrays are regualr objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the length property.</li>
          <li>Object this can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable</li>
          <li>for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>functions are a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. They're different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
